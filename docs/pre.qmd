## Introduction

Under rapidly increasing human populations, the objective of this work is to determine the optimal locations for **future cropland expansion** that balance food production, the impacts on functional habitat connectivity, and the costs associated with biodiversity and carbon.

This project uses the same [agroEcoTradeoff](https://github.com/agroimpacts/agroEcoTradeoff) tradeoff analysis model. The model was initially introduced by Estes et al. [-@estes2016] and has since been specifically evaluated for the biodiversity index component by Crawford et al. [-@crawford2021].

## Difference in this work

-   **Treat planning units differently:** Consider planning units can be partially covered by current cropland.
-   **Simplification of crop production evaluation:** The evaluation of crop production was simplified by utilizing the average yield of multiple crops.
-   **Inclusion of transport cost in crop production evaluation:** The evaluation of crop production in this work incorporates the consideration of transport cost.
-   **Integration of landscape connectivity evaluation:** Additionally, the assessment of functional landscape connectivity has been incorporated into the analysis.

Biodiversity cost: $BIp_{i} = b_{i} \times c_{i}$, $b_{i} = S_{i} + E_{i}$.

where $c = BHI$, $S = sqrt(richness * endemism)$ and $E = mean (MSA, BII)$ [@soto-navarro2020].

## Progress

Functional connectivity: arithmetic mean of importance and uniqueness of planning units to maintain functional connectivity of the whole landscape.

- Importance: $dI(\%) = \frac{I - I'}{I} \times 100$ and $PC = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^na_{i}a_{j}p_{ij}^*}{A_{L}^2}$.
- Uniqueness: Circuitscape result.

## Discussion

**Q1:** Should we consider the surrounding areas like the calculation of transport cost?

**Q2:** Should we consider all migratory large mammals to make the result more general?

**As a reviewer, what would be your criticisms, comments, or suggestions regarding the analysis design?**

## Other questions

As an experienced user, what are your thoughts and suggestions on the package if we intend to release it officially on CRAN eventually?
